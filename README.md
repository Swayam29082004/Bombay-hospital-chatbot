# Bombay Hospital Bot 🤖

Welcome to the **Bombay Hospital Bot** project! This is a Flask-based web application that simulates a conversational chatbot aimed at guiding users through a basic medical diagnostic process. It asks the user for their name, symptoms, and how long they've been experiencing them, then provides relevant precautions and offers doctor suggestions. This bot also enables users to book appointments with suggested doctors based on their symptoms.

## Features 🌟

- 🏥 **Symptom Diagnosis**: The bot engages users in a step-by-step diagnostic process to gather symptoms and severity levels.
- 💡 **Precaution Suggestions**: Provides useful precautions based on the entered symptoms.
- 🩺 **Doctor Recommendations**: Suggests specialists according to the user’s condition.
- 📅 **Appointment Booking**: Allows users to book appointments with doctors directly through the chat.
- 🔄 **Interactive Chatbox**: A dynamic chatbox interface that enhances user interaction.
  
## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Data**: Pandas (for handling CSV files containing symptom data)
- **Timezone Handling**: `pytz` for managing timezones
- **API**: RESTful API endpoints using Flask
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for reading and processing symptom data
  - `datetime` for time-based greeting generation

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The bot greets the user and asks for their name.
2. The user is prompted to provide their symptom.
3. Based on the provided symptom, the bot asks how long the user has been experiencing it.
4. The bot randomly selects a symptom from a dataset and provides precautions related to it.
5. The bot suggests a relevant doctor for the condition and offers to book an appointment.
